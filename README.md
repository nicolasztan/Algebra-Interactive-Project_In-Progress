#Straight Line Equation Project
3 mini projects for Algebra Teaching

The purpose is to teach kids with an interactive experience about the classic algebra formula “y = mx + b”. 

I have 3 mini sections here. 

FIRST:
"final.html" does the following:
+ Present a graph of a line
+ Interactively adjust the slope (m) of the line via x-y intercept inputs
+ Update the graph of the line in realtime
+ Clear canvas and user input 

SECOND:
"canvas-learn.html" is an off-topic project to compensate for the lack of features in algebra.html. 
Here, I showcased the vast powerful art that can be done with HTML5 Canvas.
The side project was basically revolving on the concept of variously multi-colored balls that bounce 
around a responsive window and when a mouse hovers over some distance of a fixed number of pixels, the balls would grow in size and then shrink when away from them


THIRD:
 "slider.html" is a simple slider that can be added to the algebra.html components embedded on the same page if using more than just Vanilla JS, but like with ChartJS and more.
 I would have a chart overlapped above an aesthetic glass display, where the sliders would influence the line a user can play with.
